# Order-Book-Modelling
R Code for limit order book (LOB) modelling

The R code here was written as part of an essay "Stochastic Modelling of Limit Order Books in Continuous Time".

It is split into 2 sections:
Section 1 investigates the reliability of a model proposed by Cont and Larrard in their 2013 paper "Price dynamics in a Markovian limit order market"
Section 2 investigates the market microstructure, in particular examining
  (i)  Order arrival rate
  (ii) Order size distribution
